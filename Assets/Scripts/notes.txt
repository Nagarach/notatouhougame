need to preload all the enemies

i dont need to figure out how many pooled bullets i need for each enemey, bullets are generic
  enough that i can change anything about them when they are rewoken. So i just need a number
  of bullets that can be on the screen at once, say 1000.

so i have the gamecontroller pool all the enemies in a list and set them to all that they
  are supposed to do and activate them acoording to their timing in the stage.
  
2d bezier spline for enemy paths?

that nifty idea of using particles managed by c# objects instead of millions of gameObjects
